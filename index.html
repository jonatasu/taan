          <p>How many times have you had an honest, revealing conversation with the head of another agency? Hardly ever? Maybe never?</p>
          <p>Taan’s uniqueness arises from the honest willingness of its member agencies to openly share their personal experiences, expertise, ideas, best practices, specialties, successes, failures and even their dreams for the future. In addition to their financials.</p>
          <p>Taan helps agency owners and leaders operate in less of a vacuum by revealing winning new business strategies, providing a sounding board for new ideas and directions, sharing hard operating data and fostering non-competitive, cooperative relationships with other Taan agency peers.</p>
          <p>In a candid, confidential forum – at Taan meetings and in between – members share their collective knowledge to expand their vision, improve decision-making and increase success rates. Taan helps its member agencies view their businesses and emerging trends with eyes larger than their own; hear new ideas with ears more sensitive than their own; and multiply their own personal experience by a factor of 50 or more.</p>
          <p>Taan makes each of its members a more effective chief executive, a leader more fully in control of managing their agency’s future. That’s the power of the Taan group dynamic.</p>

                  <h3>Taan’s Value in Your New Business Efforts</h3>
                  <p>As an organization, Taan can help your new business efforts in several ways.</p>
                  <p><strong>New Business Presentations:</strong> Only at a Taan meeting will you get to see actual new business presentations made by member agencies that helped them get into the finals of a pitch and ultimately to win the business.</p>
                  <p><strong>Successful New Business Strategies:</strong> Members share their new business techniques at regular meetings and often in-between. New ideas for prospecting, positioning, gaining visibility and selling more profitable compensation packages are regularly discussed.</p>
                  <p><strong>Specialization:</strong> With increased emphasis on integrated communications, global marketing, digital solutions and unique media choices, clients are often looking for specialized services that fall outside many agencies capabilities. Taan members can effectively and profitably provide the services that your agency might not have through the diverse capabilities and cooperation of its members and affiliates worldwide.</p>
                  <p><strong>Enhanced Expertise:</strong> Members can become “quick experts” in a product or service category by tapping into the expertise of other Taan members. In numerous instances, members have helped other members put together successful presentations to businesses where they had minimal or even no previous experience. In a few situations, Taan members have jointly pitched new business and have been successful in winning the account.</p>
                  <p><strong>Branch Office Services:</strong> With their close contacts in markets around the world, Taan members can provide their clients with localized, hands-on service almost anywhere they might need it.</p>

                  <h3>Experience The Open Dialogue at Taan Worldwide Meetings</h3>
                  <p>“There’s nothing more electric than a room full of intelligent people,” an editorial in AdAge stated. What an apt description of Taan’s three agency meetings held each year.</p>
                  <p>Each year, a meeting is held in the US and attended principally my US agency members. Another meeting is held in Europe and generally attended by European members. The third meeting is our annual Global meeting which is attended by all Taan members and held in different locations around the world.</p>
                  <p>All meeting agendas are member-driven with a strong emphasis on bringing in guest speakers as well as member presentations. Typically, agendas encompass areas of interest to members, including such topics as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Agency Management and Operations</li>
                    <li>Emerging Trends and opportunities</li>
                    <li>Financial Management</li>
                    <li>Growth Planning</li>
                    <li>New Business</li>
                    <li>CEO/Executive Skills Development</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>At each meeting, members report on recent developments, successes, challenges and problems at their agencies using a Taan Agency Update form which is shared with attendees in advance of the meeting. Then, in an honest, open and revealing session during the meeting, members discuss, share and try to solve some of the remarkably common challenges they each face every day in their business.</p>
                  <p>Also, Taan’s legal counsel reports on significant legislative, regulatory and judicial developments that can affect members’ business practices. Members can also receive answers to specific legal issues or situations that their agency may be facing.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, Taan’s financial counsel reports on financial management, tax planning, retirement and succession planning as well as profitability improvement strategies. This too is often followed by a responsive Q &amp; A session.</p>
                  <p>Taan meetings are great opportunities for knowledge and advice among peers and Taan’s professional counsels.</p>
                  <h4>Who Attends Taan Meetings?</h4>
                  <p>Usually the member agency’s CEO or Managing Director is the “official” Taan delegate who attends the meetings. This preserves continuity and allows members to become close friends over time. Frequently, other agency partners, senior executives and heirs-apparent accompany the CEO or even take their place when they cannot make the meeting.</p>
                  <h4>How Do Members Work Together Between Meetings?</h4>
                  <p>You might be surprised how often Taan members communicate with one another – either by email, phone, mail or even face-to-face meetings when necessary. Based on the close working relationships established at our meetings, members know who to call on for advice and assistance. Each year, network-wide surveys are uploaded to the private extranet to keep everyone current on rates, pricing, salaries and member category market knowledge and special capabilities.</p>
                  <p>“Branch office” services on behalf of clients and special work requests are provided on an hourly fee basis with the first hour free. Occasionally members have set up special joint ventures to serve clients on an ongoing basis.</p>
                  <p>Member-to-member assistance ranges from client program work (special market expertise, market research, local PR, photography and video shooting, special events, media planning, digital development, broadcast production, personal contacts, etc.) to helping pitch new business to advice on agency operations (technologies and equipment, financial issues, employee issues such as benefit plans, handbooks, compensation, succession plans, etc.)</p>
                  <h4>Special Workshops</h4>
                  <p>From time to time, Taan organizes one or two day workshops for upper and middle management of member firms. Recent workshop topics have been conducted specifically for agency CFOs and Creative staffs.</p>

                  <h4>ReedSmith for Legal Services</h4>
                  <p>Taan maintains a formal relationship with the international law form of ReedSmith, the global leaders in advertising and promotion law. And through their alliance with GALA (Global Advertising Law Alliance), Taan members can have access to legal advice and remedies almost anywhere in the world.</p>

The firm’s partner, John Feldman, Esq., regularly attends Taan meetings and is available at no charge for “quick opinions” by phone or email. Case work, if needed by members, is provided on a fee basis with estimates provided in advance.</p>
                  <p>Taan maintains a similar relationship with the Milwaukee, Wisconsin accounting firm Locatelli &amp; Company, a specialist in advertising agency financial management. In addition to receiving regular management updates, the firm’s principal, Jim Locatelli, CPA, conducts a regular financial management workshop at many Taan meetings. He is also available for “quick opinions” at no cost by phone or email. Project work is available on a fee basis with costs estimated in advance.</p>
